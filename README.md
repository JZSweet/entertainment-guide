# project-1 Entertainment Guide

* URL:https://kytaylor.github.io/project-1/

## Introduction
This application is an entertainment guide to provide movies and TV shows information to users. Users can search by name then the application will present status, schedule showtime, witch network it's on, and summary with a poster about it. The application also has a save function to help users access their favorites.

## Tools we used

### Two server-side APIs:
* OMDb API provides movies information
* TVmaze API provides TV shows information

### Local Storage
we used local storage to store and recall previous information, and we added a clear button to remove saved information as well.

### Bulma CSS styling
we used the Bluma CSS library to style the page. Bulma.io CSS framework was used to help organize elements on the page utilizing its pre-built "columns" formatting. Bulma's tools come with automated screen-size considerations, responsiveness, which made it very simple to build the page with one view in mind and be assured it'd work perfectly on another (mobile vs desktop). All additional CSS required was for simple sizing and other granular considerations.
