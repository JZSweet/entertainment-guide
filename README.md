## Introduction
This application is a entertainment guide to provid movies and TV shows information to users. User can serch by name then the appliction will present status, schedule show time, witch network it's on and summary with a poster about it. The application also has a save fuction to help user access to their favorites.

## Tools we used

### Two server side APIs:
* OMDb API provides movies information
* TVmaze API provides TV shows information

### Local Storage
we used local storage to store and recall previous information, and we added a clear button to remove saved informations as well.

### Bulma CSS styling
we used bluma css libraty to style the page. Bulma.io CSS framework was used to help organize elements on the page utilizing its pre-built "columns" formatting. Bulma's tools comes with automated screen-size considerations, responsiveness, which made it very simple to build the page with one view in mind and be assured it'd work perfectly on another (mobile vs desktop). All additional CSS required was for simple sizing and other granular considerations.
