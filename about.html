        <h>This is a group project brought to you by 4 team members. We worked on it with all the knowledge we have learned from the University of Oregan Coding Bootcamp.
            The idea was to find entertainment when we are in the middle of the pandemic when there is nothing else to do. We can all find something to take our mind off here. 
            One of our team members even had a newborn baby during this time. we hope you like this website for your entertainment guide. 
            let's all stay in and enjoy some quality TV.
