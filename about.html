                    <h>This is a group project brought to you by 4 team members. We worked on it with all the knowledge
                        we
                        have learned from the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp.
                        The idea was to find entertainment when we are in the middle of the pandemic when there is
                        nothing
                        else to do. We can all find something to take our mind off here.
                        One of our team members even had a newborn baby during this time. we hope you like this website
                        for
                        your entertainment guide.
                        Let's all stay in and enjoy some quality TV.
